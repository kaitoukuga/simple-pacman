# Pacman
I've made a simple Pacman Game using JavaScript function
It's only work on pc web browser

You move with Arrow Keys and WASD Keys, click restart if you Game Over.
No Leaderboard, No Highscore, it's just a simple Pacman for fun.

I'm a beginner programmer, this project is just a test project to implement my new knowledge about complex JavaScript function.
That's why I'm making it simple. 

Have Fun :D
